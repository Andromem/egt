This chapter discusses how to to use colors and palettes.

@section colors_classes Color and Palette Classes

Color and Palette are used for managing colors and palettes of colors.

@section colors_global The Global Palette

There is a single global palette accessible directly with the function
global_palette().  All widgets use this palette by default and
before creating widgets, this palette can be changed.

However, you can also change the palette for any individual widget and it will
only have an affect for that widget. The local palette for a widget is
accessible with the Widget::palette() function.

If you change the global palette, it will retroactively have an effect on any
widget, as long as that widget does not have a custom palette assigned.  In
other words, as long as the widget's palette has not been changed.  Changing any
property of an individual widget's palette, results in that widget
maintaining its own complete and independent palette from the global palette.

@section colors_themes Widget Themes

EGT does not use native style widgets by default.  It defines the look and feel
of its own widgets.  The look and feel of these widgets can be extended
or changed in several ways.

1. The first method is to register a new draw function for a specific widget
   type.  This will make the new draw function apply to any widget of the same
   type.
2. The second method is to derive from an existing widget and create a new
   widget type, with a new default draw function.
