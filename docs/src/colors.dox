 @page colors Palette and Colors

This chapter discusses how to to use colors and palettes.

egt::Color and egt::Palette are used for managing colors and palettes.

There is a single global palette accessible directly with the function
egt::global_palette().  All widgets use this palette by default and
before creating widgets, this palette can be changed.

However, you can also change the palette for any individual widget and it will
only have an affect for that widget. The local palette for a widget is
accessible with the egt::Widget::palette() function.

If you change the global palette, it will retroactively have an effect on any
widget, as long as that widget does not have a custom palette assigned.  In
other words, as long as the widget's palette has not been changed.  Changing any
property of an individual widget's palette, results in that widget
mainting its own complete and independent palette from the global palette.
