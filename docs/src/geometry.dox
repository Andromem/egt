 @page geometry Geometry

This chapter discusses the coordinate system and how to deal with geometry in EGT.

@section geometry_coord Coordinate System

EGT defines a PointType, SizeType, RectType, LineType, ArcType, and CircleType
along with several other classes for working with geometry.

EGT uses a standard Cartesian coordinate system that specifies each point
uniquely in a plane by a set of numerical coordinates, which are the signed
distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines, measured in
the same unit of length. Each reference line is called a coordinate axis or just
axis (plural axes) of the system, and the point where they meet is its origin,
at ordered pair (0, 0).  The default for all origins in EGT is the top left or a
rectangle. Positive X moves to the right, and positive Y moves down.

Depending on context, there are several coordinate system origins in EGT:

- Widget

@par
The widget origin is how each widget sees itself.  The origin is always relative
to its parent's origin if it has a parent.

- Display

@par
The display origin represents the entire display, irrelevant of content.  It's
simply the resolution of the display.  For example, mouse press events originate
relative to the display origin.

To help stop any ambiguity between the different coordinate systems, there are
two predefined Point types.  One is Point and the other is
DisplayPoint.  While the interface of these two types is completely
identical, they are not compatible C++ types.

@section coord_radians Radians and Degrees

While most of the geometry related to EGT deals with rectangles, it is sometimes
necessary to deal with arcs when drawing.  The following unit circle is used
when dealing with degrees or radians, depending on the API being used.  For
example, creating a CircleType or ArcType.
