 @page geometry Geometry

This chapter discusses the coordinate system and how to deal with geometry.

@section geometry_coord Coordinate System

EGT defines a egt::Point, egt::Size, egt::Rect, egt::Line, and several other
classes for working with geometry.

All coordinate systems in EGT default with an origin of 0,0 in the top left.
Positive X moves to the right, and positive Y moves down.

There are three coordinate systems in EGT:
- Window

@par
The window coordinate system is what the widget hierarchy sees as the root.  A Window manages a surface, so that overall surface has a coordinate system.

- Local/Widget

@par
The local coordinate system is how each widget sees itself, and in the case of a composing widget like a frame, it's the relationship between the frame's box() and its child widgets.

- Screen/Display

@par
The screen coordinate system represents the entire screen, irrelevant of content.  It's simply the resolution of the screen.  For example, mouse press events originate on the screen coordinate system.

@section coord_radians Radians and Degrees

While most of the geometry related to EGT deals with rectangles, it is sometimes
necessary to deal with arcs when drawing.
