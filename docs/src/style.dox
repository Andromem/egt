 @page style Coding Style

The C++ coding style of the EGT project mostly adhere's to the Allman style with
a couple exceptions.  This coding style is enforced throughout the codebase.

<a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/">Astyle</a> is used to enforce this
coding style with the *scripts/style.sh* script. This can be automatically
executed for all of the source code with a make target by typing:

@code{.sh}
make style
@endcode

Be careful not to abuse this and change coding style just for the fun of it,
especially on source that you are not currentoly working on.
