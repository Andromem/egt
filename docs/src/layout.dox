 @page layout Layout

This chapter discusses how Widget layout works.

Before diving into this, understanding @subpage geometry "Geometry"
semantics in EGT is necessary.

@section layout_box The Widget Box Model

@ref draw_loop first introduced the idea of the Widget @b box.  Understanding
the Widget @b box is an important concept not only when it comes to understanding
how widgets are drawn, but also in understanding position and layout. Each
Widget has a @b box accessed with Widget::box().  This is a Rect that has an
origin and a width and height.  If you call Widget::move() or Widget::resize(),
the box is changed.  When drawing or performing layout, this is the box that is
used or @a owned by the Widget.  By default, when a Widget is told to draw, the
Painter will be clipped to be within the Widget's box.

Within the Widget @b box, each widget also has a @b margin, @b border, and @b
padding width. These are intrinsic properties that are used when drawing a
widget.  How each of these properties applies visually is very similar to CSS
constructs and is demonstrated with the following diagram.

@image html layout.png
@image latex layout.png "Layout" width=8cm

In the case of a background color, it goes to the inside edge of the border.

@image html layout2.png
@image latex layout2.png "Layout Fill" width=8cm

The widget box itself has no width.  If any of the other properties like margin,
border, or padding are set to zero they have no width.

@section layout_intro Layout

There are two main ways to layout widgets: @b Fixed and @b Fluid.  These are not
mutually exclusive within the same application and can easily be mised together.

@par Fixed
The first is absolute position and sizing.  This is limiting and usually less
preferred because it hard codes a layout to a specific display resolution and is
otherwise not fluid when manipulating the layout by adding or removing widgets
later during development or even dynamically at run-time.  This can easily be
cumbersome, but it's precise and works exactly as expected when desired.  The
only thing used to do position and size with this method is whatever the box()
of each widget is. This means that you must explicitly construct or set the size
and position of each widget manually with the proper size and position.
However, what tends to happen is the developer ends up doing the same
calculations that could otherwise be specified simpler with the fluid method.

@par Fluid
The second method is automatic, or fluid, positioning and sizing based on rules
that take into account various properties of widgets.  The result is the box()
of the widget is automatically changed, instead of being directly set. This
constraint-based approach to design allows you to build user interfaces that
dynamically respond to both internal and external changes.  It also goes without
saying, it also allows you to skip the sometimes tedious math in your head that
is usually involved with fixed positioning.

## Widget Alignment and Layout Properties

Each widget has a Widget::align() setting. Each widget also has a
Widget::min_size_hint() to bound the smallest size the widget can be. If a
widget has an alignment value of empty, usually the default, whatever size it
has will be used while still taking the Widget::min_size_hint() into account. If
the alignment value of the widget is empty, the size of the widget will
automatically be calculated based on several other properties, usually based on
some ratio like Widget::xratio(), Widget::yratio(), Widget::horizontal_ratio(),
or Widget::vertical_ratio() in relation to the widget's parent.

## Layout Widgets

EGT provides several widgets like BoxSizer and StaticGrid to help with automatic
layout.  See @ref sizers for a complete list.

The layout algorithm used by sizers is based upon the idea of individual widgets
reporting their minimal required size and their ability to get stretched if the
size of the parent widget has changed. This will most often mean that the
programmer does not set the start-up size of a widget, the widget will rather be
assigned as a child to a sizer and this sizer will set the recommended size of
the widget. This sizer in turn will query its children (which can be other
widgets or even sizers) so that a hierarchy of sizers can be constructed.

@section layout_zorder Z-order

The z-order of widgets is the order in which they are drawn, or composed.
Widgets are drawn from the bottom up.  By default, widgets are drawn in the
order in which they are added to a Frame.

If you add() a Label, and then add() a background ImageLabel that covers the
entire window, you will not see the label unless the background image is
transparent. To change this, you have to fix the z-order of the widgets by
either lowering the ImageLabel or raising the Label.
